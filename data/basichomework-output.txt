bmi       0.109272  1.000000  0.012759  0.198341
children  0.042469  0.012759  1.000000  0.067998
charges   0.299008  0.198341  0.067998  1.00000012. My assumption that age is correlated with charges is moderately positively shown in the correlation.It could be the data itself.  However, I could say that age has a stronger correlation with charges compared to BMI and number of children.
